CORS --. Cross Origin Resourse Sharing
allows you to break the same origin policy of a browser

Access-Control-Allow-Origin 
foo.com/foo.com // origin should be same for req/res
foo.com/* // everybody is allowed
foo.com/moo.com // browser blocks

to enable CORS, browser will always send a origin and expects the server to send header with Access-Control-Allow-Origin 

-->
origin: foo.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT
<--
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: foo.com
Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT

// test-cors.org

the browser sends what's called a "pre-flight" options request first to check to see if it can send a POST request later on. //OPTIONS //Method --> then POST
