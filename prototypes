Prototype is equivalent to parent

let x = {}

__proto__ is a deprecated parent under which all properties are present including constructor property which is referenced to a function which is used to create the object

every object directly or indirectly connected to Objectbase, objectbase don't have __proto__ or prototype, it's the base

Single instance of Objectbase all objects are referenced to it

Object.getPrototypeOf(x) === Object.getPrototypeOf(y) //true
x.__proto__ === y.__proto__ //true //should be used as it is deprecated

Javascript use prototypical inheritance to search for property up above the chain

myArray --> arrayBase --> Objectbase
